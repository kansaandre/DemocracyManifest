# DemocracyManifest
Direct Democracy Solution: Built by the people, for the people. It works within today's democratic system, creating a party whose agenda is directly controlled by public input through our secure, ID-verified online platform. No more relying on representatives to 'interpret' public opinion—this party's program is the real voice of the people.

When representative democracy was established, physical, slow communication made it the only viable solution. Representatives could gather, discuss, and relay the people's views. Today, the internet allows instant, direct connection. We no longer need representatives vulnerable to bad influence—let's cut out the middleman and demand real, direct results.

We aim for this project to serve as a comprehensive template for direct democracy parties at all levels of governance—municipal, regional, national, and multilateral. This includes providing detailed guidelines, robust software implementations, and additional tools to facilitate and promote direct democratic practices globally.
